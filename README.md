🎓 Why I Built This:

I created JEE Prep Hub for myself during my JEE 2026 preparation because I was constantly switching between paper planners, apps, and random to-do lists.
This dashboard brought everything into one place tracking exams, staying on top of tasks, and most importantly that countdown gave me the push I needed every day to stay consistent. Seeing the days tick down was both scary and motivating, and that’s what kept me disciplined.
As it is ad-free, it keot me away from distractions.
